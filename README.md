# To-Do List App

## Description

_Duration: 4 Hours_

A To-Do application that will track tasks that you need to complete, tasks you have already completed, and when you completed them! Along with the tools you need to make errands easy! This application will efficiently do all the following:

- Allow you to enter a new task
- Track you To-Do tasks in the order they were created either ascending or descending
- Mark tasks as complete and push them to the bottom of the list to make room for unfinished tasks
- Edit a task incase you need to add or remove from it
- Delete a task that is no longer needed
- Confirm the deletion of a task to make sure you don't accidentally lose something important
- Gives a stylish and responsive feel so you can use it on your phone, tablet, or desktop
